# Aryabhatta-Search 

Unified Digital Education Platform for Lifelong Learning

---

### Problem Statement  
The digital education space suffers from information overload and lack of relevance. Learners from kindergarten to post-graduation struggle to find organized, age-appropriate content tailored to their needs. Existing platforms are fragmented, making it difficult to discover trusted resources, interactive tools, and community support in one place.

### Solution  
Aryabhatta-Search is an AI-powered platform that unifies educational content across all academic levels. It combines a smart search engine, structured content organization, interactive 3D models, and community-driven learning to simplify discovery and enhance understanding.

### Key Features  
1. AI-Powered Search Engine  
   - Generates concise summaries of topics using LLMs (e.g., "What is the chain rule?") and organizes results into structured categories (Definitions, Applications, Examples).  
   - Integrates Google Programmable Search to pull resources (articles, videos, books) and ranks them by relevance and user ratings.  

2. Adaptive Content Recommendation  
   - Prompts users to take a quick diagnostic test to assess knowledge gaps.  
   - Recommends tailored resources (videos, articles, books) based on test results and age/grade.  

3. Interactive 3D Model Gallery  
   - Explore 3D models (e.g., human heart, solar system) from a curated database.  
   - Users can upload, rate, and review models to grow the repository.  

4. Dynamic Difficulty Filtering  
   - Content is auto-filtered by difficulty (e.g., 5th-grade vs. postgraduate) using age/grade data from signup.  

5. Community-Driven Learning  
   - Discussion forums for topic-specific queries and peer support.  
   - Parental controls to monitor progress and restrict content for younger learners.

### Example User Flow  
*A 5th-grade student struggles with percentages:* 
1. Searches "percentage basics" â†’ takes a 5-minute diagnostic test.  
2. Platform recommends simplified videos, interactive exercises, and a 3D pie-chart model.  
3. LLM-generated summary explains core concepts, linking to structured sections (Introduction, Formulas, Real-World Applications).  
4. Student joins a forum to ask questions and shares a self-created 3D model for visualizing percentages.
